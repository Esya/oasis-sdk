# Changelog

## v0.1.0-alpha1

Spotlight change:

- We'll now be putting this on npm.

Note: nonbreaking changes made before v0.1.0 aren't catalogued.
Ask us directly or see the Git history for what changed.

## v0.0.2

Spotlight change:

- Runtime method wrappers now return a class with methods that let you sign
  and submit the transaction separately.
  This applies to query methods too, even though there's no signing step, for
  more minor reasons.

## v0.0.1

Spotlight change:

- Electrical anomalies have caused a Ctrl+V of the rest of this repository
  to be pasted as TypeScript instead of Rust.
